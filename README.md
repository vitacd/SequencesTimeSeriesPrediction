# SequencesTimeSeriesPrediction

This folder contains jupyter notebooks for the exercises in Coursera course: **Sequences, Time Series and Prediction**, part of the DeepLearning.AI TensorFlow Developer Professional Certificate. This course demonsrates the use of RNNs and Tensorflow in time series modeling. 
#### Table of Contents
#### - Simple statistical techniques such as moving average, see W1_Naive_Movingavg,ipynb.
#### - Simple RNN for prediction, see W2_RNN.ipynb.
#### - LSTM layer, see W3_LSTM.ipynb.
#### - Add a Conv1D layer, see W4_AddConv1D.ipynb.
W1-W3 use synthetic data generated in the .ipynb. W4 uses real data 'daily-min-temperatures.csv' in the folder.
